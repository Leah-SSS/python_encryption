I need to start a "drawing a day challenge"
To job or not to job
Pokemon, which one is my favourite?
I should go back to making website, then maybe I can get a job.
I want to leave the UK, and go to a whole new world~
I woke up, but want to sleep.
I want to eat Taki-gomi-rice... or maybe taki-gomi-Pasta?!
Where's Calpis? I can't sleep without it (bottle)
Need a Pokari-Sweat? Its Soy Calor!
Sword Deluge! or Into-the-depth-of-the-Sea! I could really go into a tale of my own...
Ni-hongo Waka-rima-sen!
